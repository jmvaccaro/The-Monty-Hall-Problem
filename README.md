## The Monty Hall Problem
Simulation of the Monty Hall Problem in Python

The contestant must choose one of three doors (all closed); the prize is what is behind the chosen door. It is known for sure that behind one of the doors is a car, and behind the other two are goats. Once the contestant has chosen a door and communicated their choice, the host, who knows what is behind each door, will open one of the other two doors where there is a goat. Then, the host gives the contestant the option to switch doors, if they wish (they have two options).

Should the contestant stick with their original choice or switch to the other door? Is there any difference?

This solution is based on three basic assumptions:

The host always opens a door.
The door the host opens always has a goat behind it, since they know what is behind each door.
The host picks one of the remaining two doors after the contestant has made their choice.
